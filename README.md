# 📘 Day 18 – Burp Suite & HTTP Request Manipulation
## 100 Days of Hacking – Study Notes

## 📌 Overview
On Day 18, I explored Burp Suite to understand how HTTP requests can be intercepted, modified, and replayed to manipulate web applications.

This study was conducted in a controlled and legal lab environment for educational purposes.

## 🔍 What is Burp Suite?
Burp Suite is a web application security testing tool used to:
- Intercept HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Analyze requests and responses
- Modify parameters and headers
- Replay requests to test application behavior

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Client-side controls can be bypassed easily
- Hidden parameters often exist in HTTP requests
- Server-side validation is critical
- Application logic flaws are often exposed via request manipulation

---

## ⚠️ Security Insight
Trusting user input or browser-side validation leads to vulnerabilities.
Security must be enforced on the server.

---

## 🛡️ Defensive Takeaways
- Always validate input server-side
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Monitor abnormal or repeated requests
- Log and analyze suspicious activity

---

## 📅 Progress Tracker
